Overview
ModernGlass is built to provide decentralized, tamper-evident, and cryptographically secured data provenance. It focuses on trusted insights and real-time data processing. The system stores provenance records across a decentralized network. Each record carries a cryptographic signature and links to the previous state. The result is an immutable ledger of data events that can be audited end-to-end.

The design aims for clarity and reliability. It favors simple, well-documented interfaces. It supports teams that need verifiable data lineage across systems. It also helps data engineers prove the origin of a claim, the sequence of events, and the integrity of the data.

What problem ModernGlass solves
- Data lineage is often fragile. It can be altered, lost, or hidden. ModernGlass provides a robust chain of custody.
- Trust is hard in distributed setups. Cryptographic proofs make it possible to verify data provenance without trusting a single party.
- Real-time insights require a fast, secure path from data generation to insight. ModernGlass emphasizes low latency and verifiable state updates.
- Compliance and governance need auditable trails. ModernGlass offers transparent, auditable provenance records.

How ModernGlass works
- Provenance blocks form a chain. Each block contains event data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic signature.
- A Merkle tree is used to commit a large set of events efficiently. This keeps proofs compact and fast to verify.
- Signatures ensure authorship and non-repudiation. Public keys map to trusted operators in the network.
- A decentralized network stores and replicates provenance, so a single point of failure cannot erase history.
- Real-time processing pipelines emit events that are batched, hashed, and tied into the ongoing provenance chain.

Core concepts
- Provenance record: A digital, timestamped event with metadata and cryptographic evidence.
- Block: A collection of provenance records with a hash of the previous block, creating a chain.
- Cryptographic proof: A signature or a Merkle proof that confirms data integrity and origin.
- Decentralization: No single authority controls the entire provenance history.
- Tamper-evidence: Any alteration to past records breaks the chain and is detectable.
- Real-time analytics: Ingest, verify, and derive insights with minimal delay.
- Access control: Fine-grained permissions control who can append, query, and verify.
- Privacy controls: Data minimization and selective disclosure mechanisms.

Data model
- Event: A discrete data point or action, with fields like id, type, payload, source, and metadata.
- ProvenanceBlock: Contains an array of events, a block hash, a previous block hash, a timestamp, and a signature.
- Identity: Public-key based identity for issuers and readers.
- Signature: Digital signature over the block or event payload, enabling verification.
- Proof: A cryptographic artifact that proves data integrity for a given query or export.
- Anchor: A reference to an external trusted timestamp or anchor source for added reliability.

Architecture blueprint
- Ingest layer: Accepts data from multiple sources, normalizes it, and assigns a provisional event structure.
- Prover layer: Creates cryptographic proofs for events, builds Merkle trees, and signs blocks.
- Ledger layer: Stores blocks in a decentralized, replicated ledger. Verifications occur as new blocks are added.
- Query layer: Provides read-only access to provenance with filters, proofs, and exports.
- Access control layer: Enforces permissions for writers, readers, and verifiers.
- Archive and retention: Policies for data retention, pruning, and archiving while preserving proofs.
- Clock and time sources: Trusted timestamp services ensure consistent ordering of events.
- Interoperability layer: Bridges to external systems, such as message queues and data lakes.

Quick start guide
- Step 1: Install
  - Pick the asset that matches your OS and architecture.
- Step 2: Configure
  - Create a simple config.yaml. Include data sources, security keys, and network peers.
- Step 3: Run
  - Start the service. It will begin ingesting data, building proofs, and appending blocks to the ledger.
- Step 4: Verify
  - Use the query interface to fetch a provenance trail and validate the cryptographic proofs.
- Step 5: Export
  - Export provable trails for audits or external analytics.

Real-time data processing
- ModernGlass is designed to handle streaming data. It accepts events from multiple streams with low latency.
- Ingest pathways can be configured to accept Kafka, MQTT, HTTP, or file-based streams.
- Each incoming event is assigned a provisional identity and timestamp, then wired into a provenance block.
- The system batches events into blocks based on size or time windows. Each block is hashed, signed, and linked to prior blocks.
- Downstream analytics can query provenance in real time, requesting proofs for any subset of events.

Security and trust
- Cryptographic signaling: Every block carries a signature that proves its origin and integrity.
- Decentralization: The ledger is replicated across multiple peers. Tampering in one place does not alter the rest.
- Tamper-evidence: Changing an event or block breaks the chain, making tampering detectable.
- Key management: Public keys identify issuers. Private keys stay with trusted operators and sign blocks.
- Replay protection: Nonce and time checks prevent replay attacks on events.
- Access controls: Role-based access ensures only authorized users can write, read, or verify. Permissions are auditable.

Privacy and compliance
- Data minimization: Store only necessary fields, with sensitive data masked or encrypted where possible.
- Privacy by design: Access to raw payloads may be restricted. Provers can reveal selective disclosures as proofs.
- Compliance readiness: Provenance records come with auditable trails suitable for audits and governance reviews.
- Data retention policies: Define how long blocks remain in the ledger and how they are archived.

- Chain integrity: Each block includes a hash of the previous block. The chain is cryptographically linked.
- Tamper detection: Any change to a block or event invalidates the chain and triggers alerts.
- Identity assurance: Issuers provide public keys. Verifiers check signatures against known keys.
- Key rotation: Regular key changes reduce risk. Old keys are retained for verification of historical blocks.
- Threat model: The system assumes untrusted networks and potentially compromised nodes. It relies on cryptographic proofs and replication to maintain trust.

Data governance and policy
- Role definitions: Writers, verifiers, auditors, and readers each have distinct duties.
- Policy management: Access policies can be tied to organizational roles or external identity providers.
- Data retention: Blocks are retained for a defined period while proofs remain verifiable.
- Export policies: Data exports respect privacy constraints and disclosure rules.

Operational guidance
- Monitoring: Set up dashboards for ingestion rates, block latencies, and verification times.
- Alerts: Notify operators on anomalies, such as proof failures or unusual data patterns.
- Backups: Regular backups of keys and configurations help recover from failures.
- Disaster recovery: Restore from trusted snapshots and re-sync provenance across peers.
